			<h2>BIO</h2>
			<p class="biog">My name is Kris Estacio, I am a 22 year old Visual Communication Design student studying at Eastern Washington University. I started out as a Computer Science major but made the switch to Visual Communication Design when I realized that I did not enjoy coding as much as I though I would. VCD to me, has the right mixture of both creative freedom as well as precise planning that is very stimulating for both sides of the brain. On top of that, this major is very challenging, but because of that it is quite rewarding.<br>

			<h2>PROFESSIONAL OBJECTIVES</h2>
			<p class="profob">As a young designer who still has a year to go until I graduate the thought of what I'd like to do after school has not crossed my mind in any serious capacity. I can only say that I'd like to lend my skills designing things for a young audience (16-25 year olds), wheather that be packaging design, web design, etc., that is the demographic I am most interested in.</p>	


			<h2>HOBBIES</h2>
			<p class="hobbies">While I'm not focusing on graphic design or school related activities I have quite the range of interests. I love doing active things like hiking, cycling, skateboarding and also kickboxing (amongst other combat sports). I  have kickboxed since middle school and since then I have stopped doing it competatively, but still coach and corner local fighters. Outside of more active activities, I have a passion for E-Sports or Professional Gaming, more specifically I enjoy the game League of Legends as both a player and analyst. I follow the professional scene very closely and I'd say it's the one activity that takes most of my freetime.
